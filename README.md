**INCOMPLETE APPLICATION**

// The Application is, unfortunately, not complete.  
//It does retrieve data from two text files and combines them
//in a System.out.print and displays data in the console, however it does not yet accomplish the
//requirements of alphabetical order for last names, removing first name duplicates, or getting the
//average age of the given names.

It was created as a Dynamic Web App/Maven Project.  

It has the pom.xml, -servlet.xml, and web.xml necessary for what it 
accomplishes now.  

There is a basic JSP that utilizes NO css yet.   

A basic http servlet request's user name and returns their name to personalize the experience...
(at least it will be personal when its completed..  its just a text output now).
