Java files requested by Genova

This particular application is an answer to the Genova Java code test.

I've utilized Spring MVC to complete the project.  
I'm currently utilizing java 1.8.0_74.


1: A "Person" object class was created because the text files contains people and their first name, last name, and age.

Private Field variables were created for first name, last name, and age.   Getters/Setters were added along with a constructor and a toString().

2: A DAO was implemented to access all data from the supplied text files.
Utilizing an arraylist, grabbing line by line, splitting on tab and utilizing []tokens.

3: A controller(Spring) to return information to the front end.

4: index.html and multiple JSP files were used to display the requested information onto  browsers pages.
